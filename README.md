# Time It Right

Timer-based game where users try to stop a timer at exactly 10 seconds. Built with FastAPI and Clean Architecture.

## Architecture

Clean Architecture with FastAPI:
- **Domain**: Entities and value objects
- **Application**: Use cases and business logic
- **Infrastructure**: Database and external services  
- **Presentation**: API endpoints and schemas

## Database

SQLite with async support via SQLAlchemy 2.0 and aiosqlite.

## Game Rules

- Target: Stop timer at exactly 10 seconds (10,000ms)
- Scoring: Based on deviation from target
- Leaderboard: Ranked by lowest average deviation

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register/login with JWT tokens
- **Game Sessions**: Start/stop timer game with accuracy scoring
- **Leaderboard**: Rankings by average deviation from 10-second target
- **User Analytics**: Personal statistics and game history
